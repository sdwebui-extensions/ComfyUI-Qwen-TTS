    - `prompt_N`: Voice clone prompt from `VoiceClonePromptNode`
- **Capabilities**: Create named voice registry for use in `DialogueInferenceNode`. Supports up to 8 different voices per bank.

### 5. Qwen3-TTS Voice Clone Prompt (`VoiceClonePromptNode`) [New]
Extract and reuse voice features from reference audio.
- **Inputs**:
  - `ref_audio`: A short (5-15s) audio clip to extract features from.

  - `model_choice`: Choose between **0.6B** (fast) or **1.7B** (high quality).
  - `attention`: Attention mechanism (auto, sage_attn, flash_attn, sdpa, eager).
  - `unload_model_after_generate`: Unload model from memory after generation to free GPU memory.
- **Capabilities**: Extract a "prompt item" once and use it multiple times across different `VoiceCloneNode` instances for faster and more consistent generation.

### 6. Qwen3-TTS Multi-role Dialogue (`DialogueInferenceNode`) [New]
Synthesize complex dialogues with multiple speakers.
- **Inputs**:
  - `script`: Dialogue script in format "RoleName: Text".
  - `role_bank`: Role bank from `RoleBankNode` containing voice prompts.
  - `model_choice`: Choose between **0.6B** (fast) or **1.7B** (high quality).
  - `attention`: Attention mechanism (auto, sage_attn, flash_attn, sdpa, eager).
  - `unload_model_after_generate`: Unload model from memory after generation to free GPU memory.
  - `pause_seconds`: Silence duration between sentences.
  - `merge_outputs`: Merge all dialogue segments into a single long audio.
  - `batch_size`: Number of lines to process in parallel (larger = faster but more VRAM).
- **Capabilities**: Handles multi-role speech synthesis in a single node, ideal for audiobook narration or roleplay scenarios.

## Attention Mechanisms

All nodes support multiple attention implementations with automatic detection and graceful fallback:

| Mechanism | Description | Speed | Installation |
|-----------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **sage_attn** | SAGE attention implementation | ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest | `pip install sage_attn` |
| **flash_attn** | Flash Attention 2 | ⚡⚡ Fast | `pip install flash_attn` |
| **sdpa** | Scaled Dot Product Attention (PyTorch built-in) | ⚡ Medium | Built-in (no installation) |
| **eager** | Standard attention (fallback) | 🐢 Slowest | Built-in (no installation) |
| **auto** | Automatically selects best available option | Varies | N/A |

### Auto-Detection Priority

When `attention: "auto"` is selected, the system checks in this order:
1. **sage_attn** → If installed, use SAGE attention (fastest)
2. **flash_attn** → If installed, use Flash Attention 2
3. **sdpa** → Always available (PyTorch built-in)
4. **eager** → Always available (fallback, slowest)

The selected mechanism is logged to the console for transparency.

### Graceful Fallback

If you select an attention mechanism that's not available:
- Falls back to `sdpa` (if available)
- Falls back to `eager` (as last resort)
- Logs the fallback decision with a warning message

### Model Caching

- Models are cached with attention-specific keys
- Changing attention mechanism automatically clears cache and reloads model
- Same model with different attention mechanisms coexists in cache

## Memory Management

### Model Unloading After Generation

The `unload_model_after_generate` toggle is available on all nodes:
- **Enabled**: Clears model cache, GPU memory, and runs garbage collection after generation
- **Disabled**: Model remains in cache for faster subsequent generations (default)

**When to use:**
- ✅ Enable if you have limited VRAM (< 8GB)
- ✅ Enable if you need to run multiple different models sequentially
- ✅ Enable if you're done with generation and want to free memory
- ❌ Disable if you're generating multiple clips with the same model (faster)

**Console Output:**
```
🗑️ [Qwen3-TTS] Unloading 1 cached model(s)...
✅ [Qwen3-TTS] Model cache and GPU memory cleared
```



## Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers librosa accelerate
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Audio Quality
- **Cloning**: Use clean, noise-free reference audio (5-15 seconds).
- **Reference Text**: Providing text spoken in reference audio significantly improves quality.
- **Language**: Select the correct language for best pronunciation and prosody.

### Performance & Memory
- **VRAM**: Use `bf16` precision to save significant memory with minimal quality loss.
- **Attention**: Use `attention: "auto"` for automatic selection of fastest available mechanism.
- **Model Unloading**: Enable `unload_model_after_generate` if you have limited VRAM (< 8GB) or need to run multiple different models.
- **Local Models**: Pre-download weights to `models/qwen-tts/` to prioritize local loading and avoid HuggingFace timeouts.

### Attention Mechanisms
- **Best Performance**: Install `sage_attn` or `flash_attn` for 2-3x speedup over sdpa.
- **Compatibility**: Use `sdpa` (default) for maximum compatibility - no installation required.
- **Low VRAM**: Use `eager` with smaller models (0.6B) if other mechanisms cause OOM errors.

### Dialogue Generation
- **Batch Size**: Increase `batch_size` for faster generation (more VRAM usage).
- **Pauses**: Adjust `pause_seconds` to control timing between dialogue segments.
- **Merge**: Enable `merge_outputs` for continuous dialogue; disable for separate clips.
